# Bumping_alert_sensor_module

A bumping avoid module that will alert users during reverse parking in a vehicle. This module also can be use to avoid any movable counterparts into obstacles. This module uses ultrasonic sensor which better in detecting obstacle which flat surface. However soft surface or any surface that can absorb sound wave will result in less effective in detection.
